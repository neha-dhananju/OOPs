    "Explaination :\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept where a new class (called a subclass or derived class) is created based on an existing class (called a superclass or base class). \n",
    "\n",
    "* By inheriting from an existing class, the subclass can reuse the code of the superclass without having to rewrite it.\n",
    "* It simplifies the codebase by allowing common functionality to be defined in a single place (the superclass) and shared across multiple      subclasses.\n",
    "* Subclasses can override methods of the superclass to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "* Inheritance supports polymorphism, where a subclass can be treated as an instance of its superclass. This allows for more flexible and general code."

    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Inheritance : Is when a subclass inherits from only one superclass. This creates a simple and straightforward class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    \n",

    "        print(\"Barking\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Dog inherits from Animal, meaning Dog can use the eat method defined in Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The class hierarchy is simpler and easier to understand.\n",
    "* Since there is only one superclass, there's no confusion over which superclass's method or attribute should be used if there is overlap.\n",
    "* With a simpler inheritance chain, the code is easier to maintain and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a subclass needs to inherit features from multiple classes, single inheritance can be limiting, requiring workarounds like composition or mix-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple Inheritance : Allows a subclass to inherit from more than one superclass. This enables the subclass to combine and utilize functionalities from multiple classes.\n",

    "# 4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does\n",
    "it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"protected\" access modifier is significant in inheritance because it allows subclasses to access and extend certain members while keeping them hidden from external access. It provides a middle ground between \"private\" and \"public,\" balancing encapsulation with flexibility in class design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance - \n",
    "* Protected members strike a balance between public and private access. They allow derived classes to access and potentially override or extend the functionality while still restricting access from external classes.\n",
    "* Protected members support the encapsulation principle by hiding the implementation details from outside classes, while still allowing subclass customization.\n",
    "* In inheritance, protected members enable derived classes to build upon or modify the base class's functionality without exposing those details to other parts of the code. This is particularly useful in designing class hierarchies where base classes define foundational behavior, and subclasses refine or specialize that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public vs Protected:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public members are fully exposed, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere, including outside the class. In contrast, protected members are only accessible within the class hierarchy, providing more control over who can access and modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private vs. Protected:\n",
    "\n",
    "Private members are completely hidden from derived classes, making them inaccessible for modification or extension in subclasses. Protected members, however, are accessible within subclasses, allowing for more extensibility while still maintaining a level of encapsulation.\n",

    "Explaination :\n",
    "\n",
    "The super keyword in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Python, Java, and others, is used to refer to the superclass (base class) of the current class. It allows you to call methods and access attributes of the superclass from within a subclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The primary purpose of super is to call methods from the superclass within a subclass. This is often done in the subclass's method that overrides a method from the superclass, where you want to add some additional functionality but also want to execute the original method.\n",
    "* super can also be used to access attributes defined in the superclass, especially when there is a need to initialize them or interact with them in a different way in the subclass.\n",
    "* By using super, you can avoid directly referencing the superclass by its name, which makes your code more maintainable. If the superclass changes, you don’t need to update all direct references.\n",
